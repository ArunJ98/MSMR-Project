            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Scientists created genetically modified organisms that require an artificial nutrient found only in laboratories. This greatly reduces the risk of radically modified organisms entering and disrupting  ecosystems.</p>


<p class="quote">"If you make a chemical that's potentially explosive, you put stabilizers in it. If you build a car, you put in seat belts and airbags," said lead researcher George Church.</p>

        <p>In this case, researchers had created E. Coli (pictured above), which is commonly used in research, with drastically different genomes that could potentially be harmful to wild ecosystems, so they added a safety measure to cause the bacterium to die when removed from the source of artificial amino acids produced in the lab.</p>

            <h2>Core</h2>


            <p>The researchers ended with three redesigned proteins and two dependent E. coli strains. By using three of these proteins rather than just one, it makes it harder for the E.coli to "escape." During the course of this experiment, a total of one trillion E.coli cells were grown. After two weeks, none of them had escaped which speaks to the tremendous success of this experiment.</p>

            <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The E. Coli used in this research can produce proteins not found in nature and are sometimes more resistant to viruses. Ensuring their containment in laboratories ensures that these organisms with wildy new genomes do not upset existing ecosystems.</p>
            <p>In the future, Church wants to require even more synthetic amino acids to make it even harder, even near impossible, for the E.coli to "escape."</p>

            <p>Codon: a three letter combination of DNA that corresponds to an amino acid or indicates that the cell should stop building a protein.</p>
