            <h1>An Asylum for GMO’s</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h2>Core</h2>

            <h3>Background Information</h3>
            <p>The bacterium E. coli uses DNA to store its genetic code. This DNA is made of a set of molecules, each of which can be represented as a letter. These letters tell the cell how to make proteins, the main actors of cells, out of strings of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. The cell picks which amino acid to use by reading the DNA in groups of three. Each of the 64 possible three letter combinations, known as codons, correspond to one of the 20 naturally occuring amino acids.</p>

            <h3>Previous Experiments</h3>
            <p>In 2013, researchers made drastic changes to the DNA of E. coli by swapping out every instance of select codons with different codons that corresponded to the same amino acid, allowing the cell to assemble the exact same protein using a significantly modified DNA sequence. Although this did cause the cell to become more resistant to viruses, it also caused the cell to pose a new threat to natural ecosystems by potentially introducing wildly different genetics.</p>

            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>If this safety lock mechanism is implemented, then the GMOs will not be able to escape their biocontainment mechanisms using compounds from their environment, and will exhibit resistance to a change in their DNA.</p>

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p>In this experiment, instead of swapping equivalant codons, scientists rewired one of the redundant codons to correspond with an amino acid made synthetically in a lab. Computational tools were used to incorporate the artificial amino acid into newly designed proteins essential to the cell’s function, causing an “irreversible, inescapable dependency.” Without this synthetic amino acid, the cell was not able to create the necessary proteins to function. Therefore, the researchers effectively locked the cell into ecosystems that contain the synthetic amino acid.</p>
